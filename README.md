Developed a music web application where users can login and listen to their favorite songs. Here a user can create his/her own room and include the list of his favorite songs. Inside every room there will be a chat box where the group of users within that particular room can have social discussion. The user who creates the room will have the option of pausing/playing the song at any time. Technology used express framework, mongo DB, nodejs and socket.io for real time sync of play and pause.(Inspired from https://www.dubtrack.fm/). (Inspired from https://www.dubtrack.fm/)
